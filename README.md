The provided C++ code implements a student management system with functionalities including adding, displaying, searching, editing, and deleting student records. It utilizes file handling with binary mode to store and manage student data in a file named students_records.dat. 

Key features include:
Student Management: The system allows for adding new student records, viewing all records, searching by student ID, updating student details, and deleting records. Each record contains fields such as name, ID, year, address, email, phone number, GPA, total amount, paid amount, and due amount.
Security Measures: The application includes a basic authentication system with username and password. Passwords and PINs are stored in binary files, with passwords being masked during input to enhance security. A PIN-based recovery system is implemented for password reset.

Differences from C Language Version:
Object-Oriented Programming: The C++ version leverages classes and methods to encapsulate functionality, unlike the procedural approach of C.
File Handling: Uses fstream for more flexible file operations compared to Câ€™s file handling functions.
Security: Implements secure input handling with masking and binary file storage for sensitive data, offering improved security over a C implementation.


This C++ implementation offers enhanced features and security measures, reflecting the advancements in programming practices and data management.
